		<h1 class = "factblock">• Dinosaurs lived on all the continents, including Antarctica.
		<br>
		<br>
		• No one knows exactly how long a dinosaur’s lifespan was. Some scientists speculate some dinosaurs lived for as long as 200 years.
		<br>

		<br>
		<br>
		• Sir Richard Owens came up with the name "Dinosaur", which means "terrible lizard".
		<br>
		<br>
		• Dinosaurs weren’t named as such because they inspired terror. Sir Richard Owen named them "terrible lizard" because he described them as "fearfully great".
		<br>
		<br>
		• You can tell the difference between a dinosaur fossil and a stone by licking it.

		<br>
		• Most fossilized dinosaur bones aren’t actually bones anymore.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Most dinosaurs weren’t very brainy.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Two of the world’s most famous paleontologists hated each other.
		<br>
		<br>
		• The nigersaurus replaced its teeth as often as every fourteen days!
		<br>
		<br>
		• If it lives in water, it isn’t a dinosaur.
		<br>
		<br>
		• The dinosaur with the longest name was the micropachycephalosaurus, which means “small thick-headed lizard”
		<br>
		<br>
		• Dinosaurs have roamed the Earth for about 82 and a half times longer than humans have.
		<br>
		<br>
		• All four-legged dinosaurs were herbivores.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Dinosaurs didn’t all go extinct at the same time, either.
		<br>
		<br>
		• One species of dinosaur had four wings, the Microraptor.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Some dinosaurs had hollow bones.
		<br>
		<br>

		<br>
		<br>
		• There’s a fossil of a protoceratops and a velociraptor caught in the middle of a deathmatch.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Some dinosaurs may have shed their skins.
		<br>
		<br>
		• The dinosaur with the longest claws were the therizinosaurs.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Some dinosaurs intentionally swallowed huge stones.
		<br>
		<br>
		• The largest carnivorous dinosaur was the spinosaurus.
		<br>
		<br>
		• We have no idea what color dinosaurs were.
		<br>
		<br>
		• The Quetzacoatlus has the wingspan of a small plane.
		<br>
		<br>
		• We’re able to estimate the speed of dinosaurs from their fossilized footprints.
		<br>
		<br>
		• One of the UK’s greatest early paleontology pioneers was not recognized in her time because she was a woman.
		<br>
		<br>
		• The kosmoceratops had fifteen horns sticking out of its face.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Deinonychuses likely used their claws to disembowel their prey.
		<br>
		<br>
		• The pentaceratops had the largest skull out of any known dinosaurs.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Most dinosaurs in Jurassic Park didn’t live during the Jurassic period.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Fossilized dinosaur poop is called coprolite, and it’s highly prized by collectors.
		<br>
		<br>
		• The largest piece of carnivore coprolite weighs about as much as a dachshund!
		<br>
		<br>
		• According to Nintendo, Yoshi is not a dinosaur.
		<br>
		<br>
		• A piece of amber from Myanmar was found with a fully preserved dinosaur tail.

		<br>
		<br>
		• Nicolas Cage once spent $276,000 on a rare dinosaur skull.

		• The world’s smallest dinosaur egg is smaller than a golf ball.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Many dinosaurs traveled in herds.
		<br>
		<br>
		• In Jurassic Park, the sounds used to create the T-Rex’s roar were from an alligator, tiger & elephant.
		<br>
		<br>
		• It’s likely that dinosaurs weren’t cold-blooded.
		<br>
		<br>
		• T-Rexes most likely only lived to a little over thirty years old.

		<br>
		• The time gap between when T-rexes & stegosauruses were alive is larger than the gap between humans & T-rexes.
		<br>
		<br>
		• The first dinosaurs were carnivores, or meat eaters. Later herbivores (plant eaters) and omnivores (both meat and plant eaters) appeared.
		<br>
		<br>
		• The Stegosaurus has the smallest brain for its body size of any known dinosaur. Its body was the size of a van, but its brain was the size of a walnut.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Measuring 50 feet, Liopleurodon was the biggest aquatic reptile, half the size of the blue whale.

		<br>
		<br>
		• Small meat eaters were most likely the smartest type of dinosaurs.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Baby Mussaurus (“mouse lizard”) are the smallest dinosaur skeletons ever found. They would fit inside a shopping bag.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Tyrannosaurus rex had huge back legs, but its tiny front legs were not much longer than human arms.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Corythosaurus had a big, hollow crest connected to its nose. The crest worked like an echo chamber, letting it make a loud blast of noise.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Struthiomimus (“ostrich mimic”), as well as other small hunters, made high-pitched, screechy noises similar to an ostrich.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Some scientists believe that Tyrannosaurus rex may have been able to run as fast as 18 mph (28 km/h). Other scientists believe it could not run at all because it was so big.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Dinosaurs that could run on two legs were called bipeds.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Slim dinosaurs such as Compsognathus and Ornithomimus were among the fastest dinosaurs. However, the cheetah can run faster than any dinosaur that existed.
		<br>
		<br>
		• It is estimated that trillions of dinosaur eggs were laid during the Mesozoic era, though fossilized eggs containing embryos are rare.
		<br>
		<br>
		• All dinosaurs laid eggs. About 40 kinds of dinosaur eggs have been discovered.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Parasaurolophus had a crest that looked like half of a trombone. The male’s crest was up to 6 feet (1.8 m) long, which was the biggest out of all the dinosaurs.
		<br>
		<br>
		• While dinosaurs had the same set of leg bones, some had feet like a rhinoceros, elephant, bird, or a pig. The biggest footprints ever found were 3 feet (1 m) across and 4 feet long. Millipedes have more legs than any other animal—up to 750.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Some dinosaurs may have had colorful skin, but scientists don’t know for sure. It’s likely that most dinosaurs had green and brown scales to help them hide among trees and plants.
		<br>
		<br>
		• Explorer Roy Chapman Andrews found the first dinosaur nest known to science in 1923 in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. Before he found the nest, scientists were unsure how dinosaur babies were born.
